These programs work together to let us find nap hosts on a local subnet.
They use multicast to find hosts that another nap host can talk to.

There are two programs napping and naplistener. Any nap host should run
naplistener in the background as a daemon process:

$ naplistener >> /var/log/naplistener.log 2>&1 &

Any nap host that wants to find other nap hosts on their local subnet
can do so by running napping:

$ napping
got ACK making directory /tmp/192.168.0.93
got ACK making directory /tmp/192.168.0.90

The end result will be directories where we can then save the indexes and
other information for each of these nodes.

./napping -g{mcastgroup} -p{port} -t{timeout} -d{peerdir} [-h]
	Listens for nap hosts on a local multicast group.
	-g{mcastgroup} multicast group (225.0.0.34)
	-p{port} port to listen on (22534)
	-t{timeout} wait for this many seconds for responses (8)
	-h this help.

./naplistener -g{mcastgroup} -p{port} -d{peerdir} [-h]
	Listens for nap hosts on a local multicast group.
	-g{mcastgroup} multicast group (225.0.0.34)
	-p{port} port to listen on (22534)
	-h this help.

The build process should make 2 copies of each program the *-host can be run
on the host and the others will run on the board.
