Nap player is a networked media player than can
share media files between different nodes on a local network.
<p>
<h4>Player</h4>
Use this app to play and share media files on your nap player.
You can use this to find other media files on other local
players and play them.
<h4>Memos</h4>
You can record voice memos on your nap player. You can also
optionally send a memo to another nap player in your local 
network.
<h4>Intercom</h4>
Alert a family member or colleague near another nap player with
the intercom feature. If they are not available you can leave 
a message for them.
