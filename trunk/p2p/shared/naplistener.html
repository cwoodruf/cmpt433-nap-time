Nap player is a networked media player than can
share media files between different nodes on a local network.
<p>
Nap player is able to automatically detect other nap players
on your local area network. You can share any or all of the 
media files on your player with other nodes on the network.
<p>
<b>naplistener</b> is a multicast server that listens on a specific 
multicast address for requests from other nodes. All nodes must
run naplistener using the same multicast IP address and port to 
be able to identify themselves to other nodes on the network.
<p>
You can partition the nap player  network by configuring naplistener
to use different IP addresses and ports for different sections of the 
network. 
<p>
Unless a password is set for the nap player network, shared content 
will still be available to any node that can make a web request
to another node.
