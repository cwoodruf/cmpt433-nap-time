These are stub scripts that run forever and create output.
They are run from the gui launcher application from the board.
If you start the script you can check that it is running with ps.
See the README in launcher for how to use them.

Run the gui applications from these scripts as its similar to 
running them from the command line and we can capture any debug
output in the launcher via the readReadyStandardError and
readReadyStandardOutput slots provided by QProcess.

When starting a second touch screen application on top of the
first touch screen application do not use the -qws command line
option as there will be issues with the touch screen 
"bleeding through".
