For music scan to work, the musicScanServer has to be running on the node. The getmusiclist.sh should be in the same directory as the musicScanServer

The GUI on the board is the musicScanClient, it sends request to the server. musicScanServer will call getmusiclist.sh and get a list of mp3 files in ~/cmpt433/public/p2p/shared and send the list to the client
