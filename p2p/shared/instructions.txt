I'm noticing that there are a fair number of steps to setting up nodes
to work.

1) get everything from the subversion repo (see code.google.com/p/
cmpt433-nap-time)

2) on your build host prior to building the gui do this (in your
~/.bashrc or equivalent)
export $PUBLIC={your public directory}

save the file and use source to run it or relog in.
Next make a $PUBLIC/bin directory:

> mkdir $PUBLIC/bin

3) next make everything (in the main svn directory):
cd napscan
make
cd ../cgiparser
make
cd ../gui/launcher
./launcher.sh
cd ../player
./player.sh
cd ../memos
./memos.sh

4) the binaries for those programs above should be in $PUBLIC/bin now.
Copy the contents of p2p in the main svn directory to $PUBLIC/p2p.
Copy the contents of gui/scripts in the main svn directory to /bin on
the board. The launcher and memos programs expect the scripts to be in
this directory (for the moment).

5) build or otherwise acquire:
qt-4.7.3 (see guide)
alsa (see guide)
common errors: test alsa by trying to run /bin/recordmemo
make sure to do the device creation step in the linux sound guide

tcl 8.4 (other versions will work as well probably)
I'd suggest put them in $PUBLIC/qt-arm-4.7.3 (and remove the opt/
qtlibs directory on the board to conserve space) $PUBLIC/tcl and
$PUBLIC/alsa. You won't have enough space for this stuff qt is 27MB
alone. Tcl must be in this particular directory or you'll have to
change the urlencode.tcl script's #! line to match where it is (either
is fine).

6) set up the environment:
Make an /etc/nap.conf (see configs/examples.nap.conf)
export napdata=/var/napdata
export napshared=/mnt/remote/p2p/shared

Change your /etc/profile so it has:
PATH="/mnt/remote/bin:/mnt/remote/p2p:/mnt/remote/tcl/bin:/mnt/remote/
alsa/bin:$PATH"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/mnt/remote/alsa/lib:/mnt/remote/qt-arm-4.7.3/lib:/
mnt/remote/tcl/lib:/mnt/remote/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

Change the /etc/boa/boa.conf so that:

DocumentRoot /mnt/remote/p2p/shared
CGIPath /bin:/mnt/remote/bin:/mnt/remote/p2p:/usr/bin
ErrorLog /etc/boa/error_log

Maybe change the machine name in there. Make a directory p2p/shared/
memos and make it world writable. You may need to make the /var/
napdata directory world writable.

You may want to change your  system to automatically mount the nfs
share /mnt/remote if you have everything stored there. Edit /etc/fstab
on the board:

{nfs server ip}:/path/to/nfs/share/on/server /mnt/remote nfs
tcp,nolock 0 0

You can then edit /etc/init.d/rcS to run the launcher-arm application:
...
# wait for network to come up
source /etc/qt_env.sh
sleep 10
mount /mnt/remote
# you may want to source /etc/profile here if things don't work
/mnt/remote/bin/launcher-arm -qws &

This should start up the gui when the board starts. You may want to
put everything on an sd card. If so change all the /mnt/remote to /mnt/
sd (or whatever the mount point is for your sd card). Copy the
contents of the public folder to the sd card. You may have problems
with symbolic links if the sd card uses fat32. You can mitigate this
by using rsync instead

> rsync -rczLtpv $PUBLIC/ /path/to/your/sd/public

What has been tested so far:
- complete build and setup
- Benny can mount ext file systems and sd cards I can't
- memo record and memo send
- player application starts
- websites work

Because all the launcher and memo stuff works through external scripts
its easy to test individual parts of the system and see what is going
wrong.

Unsolved problems:
record levels very low (alsa)
playing a memo won't stop or indicate an error (alsa)
sending a memo works most of the time - why is it failing some of the
time? (wget)
