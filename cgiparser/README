cgiparser is a ridiculously simple program that takes a GET cgi string and
returns a specified value from that string decoded. 

You could use it in boa cgi shell scripts this way:

#!/bin/sh
doaction.sh `cgiparser -naction= "$QUERY_STRING"` "$QUERY_STRING"

This would run the script doaction.sh on the value of the action parameter 
of the boa environment variable $QUERY_STRING and also send it the original
query string if other variables need to be extracted.
