This is a collection of scripts that define the behavior of the
media player.

Mostly they are run from the gui launcher application from the board.
If you start the script you can check that it is running with ps.
See the README in launcher for how to use them. 

Run the gui applications from these scripts as its similar to 
running them from the command line and we can capture any debug
output in the launcher via the readReadyStandardError and
readReadyStandardOutput slots provided by QProcess.

Many of these scripts depend on the napdata and napshared directories
to be defined in a file called /etc/nap.conf.

See also the scripts in p2p and p2p/shared as wellas the README.

Note on scripts that started Qt applications:

When starting a second touch screen application on top of the
first touch screen application do not use the -qws command line
option as there will be issues with the touch screen 
"bleeding through".

Note on the rtp scripts:

naprtpconnect depends on 2 port variables that should be set in /etc/nap.conf
