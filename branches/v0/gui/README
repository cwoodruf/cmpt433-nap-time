This is the area for gui applications.

Use the build.sh script to simplify the build process.
See the launcher/launcher.sh script for an example.

To get the build.sh script to copy your arm binary to
public. Make a bin directory there and define a shell 
variable PUBLIC that is the path to your public directory.
Not having these is not harmful. build.sh makes 2 binaries:

$1-arm 
$1-x86

where $1 is the name of the target. 

It also defines the EM2440 c define which you can use 
like this:

#ifdef EM2440
// board specific stuff
#else
// host stuff
#endif

or 

#ifdef EM2440
#define IS_EM2440 1
#else
#define IS_EM2440 0
#endif

and then you can do this

if (IS_EM2440) {
	// board specific code
	// this can be easier to debug
}

in your source code.
