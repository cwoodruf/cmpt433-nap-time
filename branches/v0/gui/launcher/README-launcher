launcher is an application that starts other applications.

To use it on the board make these executible scripts:

/bin/memos
/bin/intercom
/bin/player
/bin/getparams
/bin/getpeers
/bin/startnaplistener
/bin/mountnfs

Easiest is to copy the scripts in gui/scripts.

Run the respective apps from these scripts. Hopefully this will work.

Also, you need to either copy or link naplistener to /bin/naplistener.

For the launcher.sh build script to copy your executable make a $PUBLIC 
shell variable to your public directory and a bin directory in that 
directory. It will make 2 executables: launcher-arm and launcher-x86.
