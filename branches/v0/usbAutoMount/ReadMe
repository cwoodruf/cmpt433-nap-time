This program should be run in the background.

To manually mount the usb flash drive:

	1. insert usb flash into the bottom usb port(this is the slave one).
	2. run fdisk -l on target, I have the following:
	[root@byan-board /dev]# fdisk -l

	Disk /dev/sda: 1000 MB, 1000341504 bytes
	16 heads, 32 sectors/track, 3816 cylinders
	Units = cylinders of 512 * 512 = 262144 bytes

	   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks  Id System
	/dev/sda1               1        3816      976880   e Win95 FAT16 (LBA)

	3. run: mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/udisk
	4. voila, you can cd into that folder /mnt/udisk

To automatically mount the usb flash drive:

	1. run the program usbAutoMount in the background
	2. insert the usb flash drive into the bottom usb port
	3. the usb drive would be auto mounted to /web/udisk{pcname}, in my case, it is /www/udiskbyan-board
	4. the program will scan the root directory of the usb drive, write every mp3 file with its sha1sum,
           size and path into a file locallist in the folder /web/musiclist/
