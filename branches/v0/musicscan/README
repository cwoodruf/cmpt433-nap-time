MusicScan README (corresponds to Player README, since they work in tandem)

1.) Configure BOA to have Document Root at /mnt/sd/public/p2p/shared for the boards, or at ~/cmpt433/public/p2p/shared for a PC node, and run BOA as a background process. Place mp3 files in the shared directory to make them available for sharing. 

2.) Naplistener and napping should both be installed, and naplistener running.

3.) Copy the player binary into /bin. It will be launched by the laucher.

4.) Copy the binary file musicScanServer-arm or -host version, as appropriate, to p2p/bin/ along with the appropriate getmusiclist.sh script (i.e. board script or PC node script). The p2p/bin/ has to be globally writable because the script creates a temp file here. Also, make sure p2p/bin is in the PATH.

0.2
The binary file "musicScanServer-arm" and the script file "getmusiclist.sh" should be placed in the p2p directory on the board. If using a PC instead of the board, use "musicScanServer-host" (I do this on a netbook on my local network I've set up for testing).

I am assuming an SD card mounted at /mnt/sd.

When you launch player-arm, it will populate the view with songs located on remote nodes, looking in the p2p/shared (recursive), and locally at the root level of the SD card. 

A song selected for play that's remote gets downloaded first to a directory named cache, then played from there. 

0.1
For music scan to work, the musicScanServer has to be running on the node. The getmusiclist.sh should be in the same directory as the musicScanServer

The GUI on the board is the musicScanClient, it sends request to the server. musicScanServer will call getmusiclist.sh and get a list of mp3 files in ~/cmpt433/public/p2p/shared and send the list to the client
