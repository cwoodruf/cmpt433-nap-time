cgiparser is a ridiculously simple program that takes a GET cgi string and
returns a specified value from that string decoded. 

You could use it in boa cgi shell scripts this way:

#!/bin/sh
doaction.sh `cgiparser -naction\= "$QUERY_STRING"` "$QUERY_STRING"

This would run the script doaction.sh on the value of the action parameter 
of the boa environment variable $QUERY_STRING and also send it the original
query string if other variables need to be extracted.

cginames is another very simple program which can extract names
from cgi string should you want to read each variable with cgiparser

#!/bin/sh
for name in `cginames "$QUERY_STRING"`
do
	echo $name
	echo cgiparser -n$name\= "$QUERY_STRING"
done

They both return one value per line of output. cginames will return repeated
names in an input. You can supress this:

cginames "$QUERY_STRING" | sort | uniq

If cgiparser finds more than one instance of a name in a cgi string it will
print each value out one per line.
