Cmpt433 Nap Time Systems Media player

Use the makeworld.sh script to make all the components for the nap time media player.
You will want to define a PUBLIC shell variable that points to where the build products will go.

When running makeworld.sh give it a directory where the prebuilt alsa, oRTP and speex libraries are.
On the distribution media this is in the public directory.

Note that the code and libraries for this product are too big for the EM2440 nand memory.
To run make an nfs mount or copy the files to an sd card mounted on the board.

You will need to configure the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_DIR variables to find these. See the
example scripts in configs for how this was done on our demo / test systems.
